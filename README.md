PetHeaven is a web-based system to facilitate services to orphan animals, mainly cats and dogs, covering up all the functionalities related to them from pet adoption to doctor consultation. 
Through our system we gave a chance to adopt an animal with our adoption process and keep updating on main activities associated with the adopted animal, such as vaccination reminders, consultation reminders etc. Not only that, it helps communities to purchase items according to the animal type including the medicine that they require and pet equipment. There are several breeds of cats and dogs found in Sri Lanka and each breed has a common disease with them. Through our application we update on those diseases.

an ability to communicate with the doctors regarding the medical advice and pet shops owners regarding the matters on available products. There are six actors in PetHeaven. They are Pet Adopter, Vetrinary
